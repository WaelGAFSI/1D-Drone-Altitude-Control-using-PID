# 1D-Drone-Altitude-Control-using-PID
 This project demonstrates a simple simulation of vertical (1D) altitude control for a drone using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. It includes a GUI with interactive sliders for tuning `Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`, and setting the target altitude. The simulation also includes wind disturbances to test the controllerâ€™s robustness.
